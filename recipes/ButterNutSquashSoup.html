    <h3>Butternut Squash Soup Ingredients
These are the ingredients you'll need to make this simple butternut squash soup recipe:</h3> <br>

<h4><ul>Butter: Here, the vegetables are saut√©ed in butter, although reviewers had success substituting with olive oil, too.</ul> 
<ul> Onion, celery, carrots, and potatoes: These vegetables give body and depth of flavor to the soup, without overwhelming the squash. Once the vegetables are tender, you may use an immersion blender or blend them in batches using a standing blender to achieve a smooth, creamy texture.</ul>
<ul> Butternut squash: Use either one medium butternut squash (~2 pounds) or about 3 cups of pre-cut butternut squash.</ul>
<ul> Chicken stock: Chicken or vegetable stock makes up the base of this soup, and can be used to thin out the natural creaminess of the pureed vegetables. If you prefer a thicker soup, use less stock.</ul>
<ul> Salt and pepper: This recipe keeps things simple with just salt and pepper for seasoning. However, reviewers say it can be easily customized with spices of your choosing, including cayenne pepper, nutmeg, curry powder, sage, etc.</ul></h4>
